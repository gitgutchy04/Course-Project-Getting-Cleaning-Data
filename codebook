This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidy.txt.
subject - The ID of the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
This document describes the code inside run_analysis.R.
The code is splitted (by comments) in some sections:
Helper functions
Constants
Downloading and loading data
Manipulating data
Writing final data to CSV
Some functions to avoid code repetition and make the rest of code more clean.
fileJoin
Used to build file paths, it concatenates strings using a slash as separator.
downloadToDataDir
Downloads the given url to the given destiny file. It also creates data dir if it doesn't exist.
extractUciHarFile
Extract a file from the zipped UCI HAR file.
uciHarDataFile
Read dataset file from UCI HAR to given name and prefix. 
loadUciHarData
Loads data, labels and subjects from UCI HAR dataset to a data.frame. The returned data.frame contains a column Activity with labels integer codes, a column Subject with subjects integer codes and all other columns from data.
Downloads the UCI HAR zip file if it doesn't exist
Reads the activity labels to activityLabels
Reads the column names of data (a.k.a. features) to features
Reads the test data.frame to testData
Reads the trainning data.frame to trainningData
Manipulating Data
Merges test data and trainning data to allData
Indentifies the mean and std columns (plus Activity and Subject) to meanAndStdCols
Extracts a new data.frame (called meanAndStdData) with only those columns from meanAndStdCols.
Summarizes meanAndStdData calculating the average for each column for each activity/subject pair to meanAndStdAverages.
Transforms the column Activity into a factor.
Uses activityLabels to name levels of Activity factor.
